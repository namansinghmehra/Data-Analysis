# Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from an Excel file and visualizes the total sales amount by region using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- `sales_data.xlsx`: Excel file containing raw sales data.
- `code.py`: Python script to process, group, and visualize the sales data.
- Output: Bar chart of sales by region and a summary table printed to terminal.

## Steps to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   - Place the `sales_data.xlsx` file in the same folder as `code.py`.

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```
     python -m venv my_venv
     ```
   - Activate virtual environment:
     - PowerShell: `.\my_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
     - Command Prompt: `.\my_venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

3. **Install Required Packages**

4. **Run the Analysis Script**
